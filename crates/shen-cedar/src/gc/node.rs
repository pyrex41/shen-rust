//! The heap node: a 24-byte cell with a packed header (kind tag + mark bit) and
//! two payload words.
//!
//! # Why a hand-packed header instead of a Rust enum
//!
//! The proven spike (`gc_spike.rs`) used a tagless `{head, tail, mark}` struct —
//! 24 bytes — because it was cons-only and the *handle* (`Word`) carried the
//! "this is a cons" tag. A real heap is heterogeneous (cons, absvec, blob,
//! opaque), so a pointer-tagged handle can't say which kind a node is — the
//! **node** must carry its own kind tag.
//!
//! A safe `enum Payload { Cons{..}, Vec(..), .. }` re-encodes that kind as an
//! enum discriminant, which (because `Cons` already fills 16 bytes with two
//! arbitrary words, leaving no niche) costs a *separate 8-byte discriminant
//! word* — plus another 8-byte slot for the `mark` byte. That inflates every
//! cons cell to 32 bytes: +33% memory traffic on the list workload that is the
//! entire point of the GC. Measured, it dropped the spike's 3.5× to 2.4×.
//!
//! So the kind tag and mark bit are packed by hand into the first 8-byte word,
//! and the remaining 16 bytes are two payload words ([`Node::a`], [`Node::b`]) —
//! recovering the spike's 24-byte cons cell while still supporting every heap
//! variant. This is the "type tag in the node header" the design calls for, and
//! the layout Step 3's word-sized `Value` builds directly on.
//!
//! # Payload encoding by [`Kind`]
//!
//! | Kind     | Models               | `a`                       | `b`   | Edges        |
//! |----------|----------------------|---------------------------|-------|--------------|
//! | `Cons`   | `Value::Cons`        | head `Gc`                 | tail `Gc` | `a`, `b` |
//! | `Vec`    | `Value::Vec` absvec  | thin ptr → `Vec<Gc>`      | —     | every cell   |
//! | `Blob`   | `Value::Str`/`Error` | data ptr → bytes          | len   | none (leaf)  |
//! | `Opaque` | `Foreign`/`Stream`   | thin ptr → `Box<dyn Any>` | —     | none (opaque)|
//! | `Free`   | (on the free-list)   | —                         | —     | none         |
//!
//! The `Vec`/`Blob`/`Opaque` words own a Rust allocation; the owning [`Heap`]
//! must reconstruct and drop it on sweep (or on heap drop). Because the node is
//! plain-old-data with no `Drop` of its own, that reclamation is explicit — see
//! [`super::heap`].
//!
//! [`Heap`]: super::heap::Heap
